# NEWS Score Health App
Simple react/node app for calculating NEWS score of patients. Functionality uses a form to send patient measurements to an API that calculates a NEWS score. There is also an added feature that activates a sensor that monitors the patients vitalsigns automatically (inc. test data generator).

Note that due to timeconstraints in the making of this app, proper validation of data values and code cleanup has yet to be done.
